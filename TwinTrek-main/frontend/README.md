**MAKE A BRANCH FIRST FROM TERMINAL AND THEN ONLY CODE AND COMMIT PLEASE!!**

**NEVER COMMIT TO THE MAIN BRANCH**
- git branch (to check which current branch you are working in)

There might be a chance that the **"main**" branch in your local is call **"master"**, if so then **rename** it like following **only if needed**:
- git branch -m master main

**Requirements:**
- npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material leaflet axios

**To run app:**
- cd CPG-114
- npm start
